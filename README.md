# Group Project Description: Handcrafted Haven

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to help artisans list and sell their handcrafted products in their local community. This will give an opportunity for the artisans to showcase their works and to build a community where customers and artisans interact, share feedback, and collaborate.

## Project Requirements

- **Frontend** – React/Next.js for dynamic UI and routing
- **Backend** – Node.js with Express API and business logic
- **Database** – MongoDB for storing users, products, and orders
- **Hosting & Deployment** – Vercel

### Functional Requirements:
- **Product Listings** – Artisans can add, edit, and remove their products.
- **User Authentication** – Registration, login/logout (buyers & sellers).
- **Search and Filtering** – Customers can browse by category, price, or artisan.
- **Shopping Cart and Checkout** – Secure transaction for purchasing items.

## Project Limitations

1. **Scalability** – The final application may not handle a large number of users without further optimization.
2. **Payment Processing** – Might not be available to use payment integration API.
3. **Security Concerns** – The application might not be strongly secure.
